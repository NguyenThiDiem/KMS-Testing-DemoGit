      My name is NTD, a final year student at PNV. I come from Binh Dinh province and now Iâ€™m living in Danang city
      Because of the covid 19 pandemic, I didn't return to my hometown for a long time.

      I want to become a profesional tester. Now, I am study automation testing with KMS company, I really like about
      it.

      My strong point is hard work, I usually try to do something until it's done,
      My weakness is that I am not good at communicating in both English and Vietnamese. I think I am not confident in
      communication. However, I realize that it is my weakness and I am gradually improving it day by day
